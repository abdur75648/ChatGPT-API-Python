This repository contains code for building a terminal-based chatbot using OpenAI's recently released ChatGPT API [Released on 01/03/2023](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis). The code is written in Python and uses the [OpenAI Python library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)

## Getting Started ðŸ”§
Before you begin, you'll need to sign up for an OpenAI API key. You can sign up [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and get your API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 

Once you have your API key, you can install the openai library using pip:
* ```pip install openai```

You will need to replace the API Key in the code in order to run the chatbot
* You can do this by replacing the value of the variable `openai.api_key` with your API key, in the file [`chat.py` line 3](/chat.py#L3)

## Usage ðŸ’¬
To start the chatbot, run the following command:
```python chat.py```

You can enter your prompts and the chatbot will generate responses. It will continue to respond until you enter the message `exit` to exit the program. You can also enter ```clear``` to clear the chat history and start a new conversation.

Happy chatting ðŸŽ‰
